# Big-Mart-Prediction-Sales-App

This project is a machine learning model that predicts the sales of Big Mart items based on various attributes. 
The model is built using XGBoost Regressor and the evaluation metrics used to evaluate the model's performance is R Squared. 
The model is built on the Big Mart Sales data that contains the sales of various products in different outlets of Big Mart.

Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them

streamlit
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
xgboost
matplotlib
seaborn

Deployment
This model can be deployed as a web application using streamlit. 
The show_predict_page function can be run as a streamlit app to start the web application. 
The app takes in various attributes as inputs and gives the prediction of sales as the output.

Built With
streamlit - The web framework used
numpy - Numerical computing library
pandas - Data analysis library
scikit-learn - Machine learning library
